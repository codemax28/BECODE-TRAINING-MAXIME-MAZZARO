Internet is not a bubble cloud, internet is a wire buried in the ground.
2 computer connected to the wire can communicate betwen them.
Server a special computer directly connected to internet, web site are files on thats servers hard drive.
Every computer as an IP adresse, it's like a name, that adress help computers ton find each other.
Every personnal IT stuff that we have are not directly connected to internet, we called that client because they're connected indirectly to internet throughg an internet service provider.
If i want to go on google.com, it will send a "message" to the server where google.com is and i will have acces to the website.
It is a client-server system, the client sends a request to the server and the server sends it back to the client.
