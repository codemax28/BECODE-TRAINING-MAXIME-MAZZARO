# Maxime Mazzaro `BeCode / Web developer to become `
## About me
Hello, I'm Maxime but call me `Max`. 😎  
I'm 26 years old, i studied e-business at EPHEC and now i'm learning coding with BeCode.       
I'm passionate about **F1**🏎, I like to discover a lot of different things, for the moment i'm trying to learn how to play piano.         
**AND** of course the best thing i like to do is eat and drinking beers🍻 or wine in good company.

3. I swim really fast 🏊‍

## Three things i like the most in this universe

## Goals during my `BeCode` formation
```
Learn and understand at least the basics of as many programming languages as possible.
Like dat i will be able to learn other langage by myself.
And of course learn as much as possible.
```
    
## My fears

- Not follow the pace of courses
- Take to much time to understand a langage
- Be overwhelmed by the courses because i don't follow the pace
 
## What I m looking forward to

- `Code like a pro.`

- Work on our first project to apply all what i have already learned
- Start to be comfortable with programming languages

## Most importants things to value to work as a team
- **Communication** and **listening** is the most important thing in a team
- **Respect** each others
- **Never be afraid** to said when you can't do something, we are not robots, ask for **help**
